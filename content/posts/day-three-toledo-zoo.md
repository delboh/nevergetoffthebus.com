Now this was unexpected. A show in a zoo.

Breakfast was served in the Great Hall in the basement of the Toledo Museum of Science---through the doors, turn right at the huge stuffed yak and head down the stairs.

The stage was located between the flamingos and the aquarium.

The flamingos were as ludicrously pink as you could expect but stuck in a cage that they could not possibly fly in.

Lions could be heard roaring querulously from deep in their lair.

Did the fish have a better deal in their tanks? At least they could swim in circles but surely, if fish have desires, the sting rays pine for the open sea.

I would never go out of my way to visit a zoo but being here with 'backstage' access out of hours seemed like an exciting prospect. A conversation with the staff as to what I should go to see before the gates opened revealed that there were a pair of polar bears with a recently born cub. I decided that I should shelve my reservations about cooping up wild animals and set off though a tunnel under a freeway towards Toledo Zoo's Arctic Encounter. But all that was to be seen there was a couple of staff clearing out the bear shit and power-washing the white painted rocks to keep them sparkling white for the visitors (I can't imagine the residents were fooled into feeling more at home by a splash of whitewash).

The bears were shuttered behind some very secure looking steel doors. No plaintive noises here, and I fantasised a scene of ursine familial bliss in the fake snow cave.

Maybe having professionals trying to figure out your every physical need while also doing the best they can to keep you and your newborn as healthy and happy as possible---within the obvious confines---isn't so bad. It was hard to reconcile their situation with the unseasonal heat in Ohio, but then again northern Europeans flock to the hottest parts of their continent in the summer to bask in the searing Mediterranean sun. Maybe the bears perception in that respect is that they have lucked in.

Toledo Zoo is a long way from anything that looks like a city.

I have  memories of a sordid few days in 1991 furloughed in a cheap motel in this town.

Those memories, and the building heat were enough to convince me that a three mile cab ride to down town Toledo to see if the place had come up in the world in the intervening years was not going to be worth th effort.

I reconciled myself to a day kicking my heels until work began at four thirty.
