Our routing would take us to New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta in three weeks and it seemed crucial to go down and see the Great River close to its source before we left.

After the previous evening's stroll back from the pub with JC I had figured out that there was public boat access not far from where we were staying. So before CJ boarded the Prevost to guide us to Waite Park I donned my running shoes and headed down there.

Even this far north the Mississippi is a big river: 300 yards to the opposite bank at the River Bluffs slipway.

It was green and lush at the slipway and I considered swimming. But I had no idea how fast the water was moving, and the place was deserted so I made do with dipping my feet in.

It seemed inconceivable that this water flows for more than two thousand miles across the entire length of the United States to the Gulf of Mexico.
