This place gets talked up so much that I was expecting to be disappointed.

After the show last night we had spent the night in faceless up-market lodgings
in Littleton at the western edge of the city of Denver.

Twenty five miles away and still in the city.

(Travelling twenty five miles in a UK city is inconceivable. Twenty five miles from central London will put you in Gravesend or Slough. From central Glasgow you could be on the Isle of Cumbrae or at the top of Ben Lomond.)

Red Rocks is only a few miles along the highway that runs past the hotel entrance and for the moment at least seem to mark the limit of the metropolitan area. Beyond that all that is to be seen are some unimpressive looking scrubby hills.

The day did not start well.
I joined CJ at the hotel breakfast.

After devouring a waffle he ran from the table to a nearby bathroom and I could hear him being violently ill. He did not reappear at the table. After a few minutes I checked the bathroom but there is no sign of him.

He had talked about stomach problems ()
