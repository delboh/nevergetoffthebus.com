> Traditionally the city that care forgot, New Orleans is, perhaps, best known for its liberal attitude towards human frailties, its \`Live and Let Live' policy. To the tourist the city is first of all a place in which to eat, drink, and be merry. Generations of gourmands and tipplers have waxed fat on gumbo and bouillabaisse and pompano, and gay on gin fizzes and absinthe drips and Sazerac cocktails; many of them, Thackeray and Mark Twain ncluded, have communicated their appreciation of the \`American Paris' to the world. Generations of revelers have gone their joyous way through the Carnival Season to Mardi Gras, that maddest of all mad days when every man may be a king, or if he prefers, a tramp or a clown or an Indian chief and dance in the streets.

How long does it take for the river to flow to here from Minnesota? Could I be looking at some of the same water that passed me three weeks ago, a thousand miles north in St. Cloud?

You don't never really think about rivers as being \`great' in the UK. They define cities---Liverpool and the Mersey; Newcastle and the Tyne, Glasgow and the Clyde

the Great Rivers of the USA,

the Mississippi and the Missouri, trace a path that spans a continent

at the Mississippi delta water from ?? states / ?? % flows into the Gulf of Mexico

We had been under extreme heat warnings on and off from day one, and we had been in places where the thermometer read higher, but New Orleans has humidity: 86 per cent humidity with an air temperature of 90 degrees. "Hotter'n the devils ass-crack" was the opinion of  a passerby on Decatur, offered without looking up from the side walk as I climbed from The Prevost at 7am  in front of the House Of Blues.

Today was another headline club show slotted in to the itinerary to keep us match fit for two big shows back in Glasgow when this was over.
