What better book to read on the road?

blurb?

by Lake Erie, Cincinnati, Toledo, Buffalo

Minneapolis,

a catalogue of places on our itinerary

and a catalogue of places that lurk in memory from countless US road trips

St. Cloud even gets a mention. (Steinbeck doesn't actually go there, but he gets directions from someone from St. Cloud when he gets lost trying to get to Sauk Centre to pay homage to the author Sinclair Lewis.)

Published in the year of my birth

in the wake of the Cuban Missile crisis and the

shadow of nuclear war
