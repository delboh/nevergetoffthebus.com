Back in Ohio---Columbus this time. A catalogue of mishaps on the journey phantom bags, lost (and, thankfully, found) passports, a two and a half our delay at Heathrow airport that left us stranded in Philadelphia, a disagreement with US Customs that could have resulted in us having all of our guitars impounded. But we made it to the show.

It was hot and there was no shade on the stage. The sinking sun was directly in our faces which makes sense I suppose: if the sun set behind the stage it would have been in the audiences eyes.

Dan from Semisonic described being on stage in the sunshine as mysteryless. But our concern turned out not to be the lack of mystery but avoiding heat exhaustion. Kris, who has pretty strict conception of what can and cant be worn on a rock-and-roll stage, was reduced to wearing a bucket hat and at one point during the set sought relief in the patch of shade behind his amp. It seemed like hard work but, hey, people work hard to make a living. And no matter how much grief comes your way on tour, playing every night isn't really work.

We are, as Buddy never tires of telling us, living inside the rainbow.
