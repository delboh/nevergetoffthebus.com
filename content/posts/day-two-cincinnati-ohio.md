Everyone was a little more chilled today. The venue is a proper shed---outdoor but with a roof. Just as hot as yesterday but we didn't have the sun actually cooking us as we played. In fact by show time it was not unpleasant on the stage. No general admission though, so we love we got in Columbus from directly in front of the stage from the few who bought tickets specifically to see us is missing. But the love was there, scattered around the cavernous space and by the end of our set it was starting to feel like there was a concert in the room.

Semisonic put on a great show after us, and The Barenaked Ladies know exactly how to take the audience with them as they take the stage. Buy 10.30 they had the PNC Pavilion in the palms of their hands---Ed had five thousand people singing every word along with him and we were starting to see how this is all meant to work.
