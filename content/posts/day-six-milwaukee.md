The BMO Pavilion is right on the shore of Lake Michigan
and the view from the bus when I woke was of the sun on the water.

the geography of the city of Chicago somehow seems to indicate that it is on a lake
but I always have to remind myself that Milwaukee is not on the sea

Then again, Lake Michigan is about the size of the Irish Sea.
you could sail due north for three hundred miles from Chicago before you would land in Canada. The Michigan coast is way beyond the horizon seventy miles to the east of Milwaukee.

the clarity of the breeze from the lake that greeted me when I clambered down from the bus made it obvious that this is a fresh water coast

I set off into a tiny parcel of prairie that is Lakeshore State Park for a pre-breakfast run

and ended up in Veteran's Park looking at a statue of General Douglas MacArthur.
