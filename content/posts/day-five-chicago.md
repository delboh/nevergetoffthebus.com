Back to another back stage parking lot. This one with military levels of security; buses and the trucks checked with mirrors as they enter; metal detectors at the entrances to the lot; a second security ring and another metal detector to get to and from the bus; and a third level of security and a third metal detector to get on to the stage. Something to do with the levels of gun violence in Chicago. At least they take it seriously here, even if no one seems to care that everyone passing through the detectors has something on their person---a spanner; a guitar that sets them off.

In some states it seems like a given that there are people with weapons around. Ed has story about asking before going on stage at a show in the Midwest if anyone had something to cut a loose thread from his clothes just before he went on stage and half-a-dozen blades instantaneously appeared around him produced from the belts and pockets of the local crew. I don't doubt for a second that a few handguns would have been produced from the same company if considered necessary. [A moment's research](https://oneaimil.org/the-issue/impact-of-gun-violence/) reveals the amazing statistic that on average, someone is killed with a gun every 6 hours in Illinois. So maybe it's all necessary.

Bird attack.

In a separate compound

a selection of upmarket patio furniture and outdoor games was encircled by Portakabins kitted out as dressing rooms. One of the venue staff who was purposefully arranging cushions on the sofas approached me as I entered (through another metal detector, obviously) and introduced themselves to me as the back stage experience coordinator. Fair enough, but a hell of a job description.

Our Portakabin was indeed coordinated. Not just the furnishings that included a record player and a selection of vinyl that you might want to play. Attention had been paid to the arrangement of the fruit: bananas, apples, pears and clementines arranged in a rotating sequence on a rectangular platter. (I was relieved that the order was not alphabetical---that would have been just too weird: the sequence started with a banana. But maybe considering that is even weirder.)
